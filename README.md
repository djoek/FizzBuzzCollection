# djoek's FizzBuzz Collection

A collection of FizzBuzz implementations in python I've written and/or collected over the years. 
No need to comment that most of these are silly, I'm well aware and this is intentional. 

## Approach

Most solutions are organized as a function that looks like this:

```python
def fizzbuzz(i: int) -> str: 
    ...


```
